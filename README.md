# Run the DataWeave CLI from GitHub Actions

Instead of running the [DW CLI](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/data-weave-cli) from your local and having to wait until it finishes processing, you can use this project to run it in the cloud using GitHub Actions.

Feel free to report an issue/enhancement if you're using this tool a lot, or send a PR to contribute :)

It's an easy/basic tool. I just wanted to be able to close my computer and leave the DW CLI running in the cloud :D

## How to run

1. Fork this GitHub repo

2. Modify the file inside `files-to-run/input` to your desired input. 

    - For example, `payload.json`, `payload.csv`, etc. 
    - File name does not matter, but there **MUST** be ONLY one file under this folder at all times. If you have no input payload, simply leave the file as empty. i.e., with no content or `{}` in the case of a JSON file.

3. Modify the file inside `files-to-run/script` with your DataWeave script.

    - File name does not matter, but there **MUST** be ONLY one file under this folder at all times.

4. The output can be located in the GitHub Actions workflow run, under the `Run DW script` step OR by downloading the `output` artifact generated by the workflow run.

## Limitations

- Only one file can and must be located under the `input` and `script` folders at all times.
- Does not support custom modules or multiple inputs unless you modify the command inside `.github/workflows`
